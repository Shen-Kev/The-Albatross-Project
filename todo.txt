learn how to use debug feature

figure out airspeed sensor

Figure out LIDAR

maybe learn how to use python and java in VS code to do data interpretation and stuff like that

add header files and functions for the other sensors, implement into src_group

calibrate IMU and ESC in drhemflight setup code, uncomment those lines 
test ESC

add a way for an LED to blink or something if the SD card can't be opened

come up with a procedure to get the SD card written to without USB reuploading code

document final code really well, how to use, etc, like the readme

learn to use forks on github

battery voltage reading and recording, might have to get creative with this, maybe directly plug balance port (only like 4v) into teensy analog pin and read that way?

Test and tune PID loops
