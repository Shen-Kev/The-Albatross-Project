learn how to use debug feature

figure out airspeed sensor

test all features (PWM in, servos, motors, IMU, PID) of dRehmFlight

Figure out LIDAR, and how to chain multiple on one I2C line

maybe learn how to use python and java in VS code to do data interpretation and stuff like that

add header files and functions for the other sensors, implement into src_group

calibrate IMU and ESC in drhemflight setup code, uncomment those lines 

add a way for an LED to blink or something if the SD card can't be opened

come up with a procedure to get the SD card written to without USB reuploading code

document final code really well, how to use, etc, like the readme
