URGENT:

get compass working

get state varaibles all working


NESSESARY:

add servos to gimbal the LIDAR

document all the pin numbers 

Test and tune PID loops

document final code really well, how to use, etc, like the readme

calibrate IMU and ESC in drhemflight setup code, uncomment those lines, test ESC, also retune pitot maybe?

add a way for an LED to blink or something if the SD card can't be opened

come up with a procedure to get the SD card written to without USB reuploading code

maybe can make a test rig to test if the lidar points forwards to detect ground faster, like make a variable for tilt bias? and a function to account for taht??? this'll be a cool innovative part of the project


THINK ABOUT LATER:

learn how to use debug feature

maybe learn how to use python and java in VS code to do data interpretation and stuff like that

learn to use forks on github
