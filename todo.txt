learn how to use debug feature

figure out airspeed sensor

test all features (PWM in, servos, motors, IMU, PID) of dRehmFlight

Figure out LIDAR, and how to chain multiple on one I2C line

maybe learn how to use python and java in VS code to do data interpretation and stuff like that

add header files and functions for the other sensors, implement into src_group

calibrate IMU and ESC in drhemflight setup code, uncomment those lines
