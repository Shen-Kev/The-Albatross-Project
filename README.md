# The-Albatross-Project

This repository is based around the PlatformIO extension in VS Code

The src group folder contains all the files and functions for flight uploaded directly to the teensy, and when it is placed in the src folder it can actually be uploaded

the other_files file is for other files that aren't really used at the moment, not even for testing systems

src_programs_for_testing_systems is for main .cpp files that run in the src_group, and are ususally tests of individual systems, since the other files in the src_group are header files and won't run by themselves. 

Other folders with code are for storage
